# CV Generator

[Live Demo](https://ashish-krishna-k.github.io/React-CV-Application/)

A CV builder web app built using React as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) React course.

_This project was originally built during my first run of The Odin Project as shown in the old branch [here]() during my second run, I'm revisiting the old projects and this time I have decided to use Typescript as practice._

## THe UI

The user can fill up the forms on the left side of the webpage to create the resume. A live preview of the resume is shown on the right side of the webapp.
The personal details doesn't have a submit button any updates of those fields is previewed live while the education and experience items should be submitted for it to be populated on the right side.

## The modules

The different elements of the webapp has been split into various reusable components. The individual components are saved in the _components_ folder, while the overall section is saved in the outside _src_ folder.

## Future Plans

- Customising resume template
- Adding a download/export option
